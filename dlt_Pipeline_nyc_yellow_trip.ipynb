    "\n",
    "Our goal is:\n",
    "\n",
    "→ Fetch real trip data from the Data Engineering Zoomcamp API  \n",
    "→ Turn it into clean relational tables  \n",
    "→ Load it into DuckDB  \n",
    "→ Explore and analyze it  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the **Data Engineering Zoomcamp API** as our data source and **DuckDB** as our database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, you will learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to configure a paginated REST API source  \n",
    "- How to handle pagination that stops on empty pages  \n",
    "- How the Extract → Normalize → Load process works  \n",
    "- How to inspect and explore NYC taxi trip data  \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you will have a working pipeline processing real-world transportation data."

    "## 💡 Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### What we accomplished\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we built a complete data pipeline that:\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ Fetches NYC Yellow Taxi trip data from a REST API  \n",
    "✔ Handles pagination automatically (stops on empty page)  \n",
    "✔ Normalizes JSON into relational tables  \n",
    "✔ Loads data into DuckDB  \n",
    "✔ Provides easy data inspection and analysis  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What dlt handled for us\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ API requests with proper pagination  \n",
    "✔ JSON to relational normalization  \n",
    "✔ Table creation with proper schemas  \n",
    "✔ Database loading  \n",
    "✔ Simple dataset inspection  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Extract** downloads raw data from the API  \n",
    "• **Normalize** converts JSON into clean relational tables  \n",
    "• **Load** writes data into the destination database  \n",
    "• `pipeline.run()` executes all three steps in sequence  \n",
    "• The resulting data is easily queryable via `pipeline.dataset()` or SQL  \n",
    "\n",
    "You now have a working pipeline processing real NYC Yellow Taxi trip data!"
